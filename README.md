## Exporting you Google Places

1. Go to https://takeout.google.com to create an export of your places stored with Google.

2. To avoid long waiting times firstly click "Deselect all". Then select at least "Maps (your places)" which contain your custom Google Maps Lists and "Saved" which contains your favourite places. Optionally select "Maps" which contains your reviews and uploaded photos related to maps.

Use the "Next step" button at the bottom to go to the next page.

3. Click "Create export".

4. Wait for the export to finish. Either by
   a) staying on the page for a while, or
   b) getting an email, or
   c) checking https://takeout.google.com/manage.

   This will take at least some miniutes, sometimes an hour. If you select more than the maps exports, it can even take more time.
